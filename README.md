# Billing System

### Description
The **Billing System** is a Python-based project designed to manage and automate the process of generating invoices and calculating total costs for items purchased. This system allows users to add multiple items with their quantities and prices, calculates the total bill, and generates a receipt. It’s an ideal solution for small businesses to manage their billing process efficiently.

### Features

- **Receipt Generation**: Generates a printable bill receipt with all item details and total cost.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs and provides feedback for corrections.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive console-based interface for ease of use.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `datetime` (for date and time on receipts)
  - `os` (for clearing the screen)
  - `sys` (for program control)
